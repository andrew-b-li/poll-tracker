# poll-tracker

Description:
Poll tracker is a poll analysis program which allows for the grouping, sorting and aggregation of political polling data. The program in its current iteration works through a graphical user interface which allows for manipulations of randomly generated poll data.

How to use:
The program can be utilized by running the PollTrackerApp java file within the application package (folder). Once PollTrackerApp is run, it will open an interface with 5 different tabs. Each can be utilized as instructed below:

Setup Poll Tracker: Provide a positive integer value for each text field (# of polls, max # of available seats, # of parties). After clicking submit, the program will generate random polling data based on the parameters which were provided. 
Setup Parties: ?
Add Poll: Allows you to add a poll with a given name to replace any existing poll. The new poll added will be populated with randomly generated data which is consistent with the parameters set when setting up the tracker (i.e. party names and max number of seats).
Edit Poll: Allows you to edit the number of seat and votes of any party within the poll tracker. 
Visualize Polls: Provide a text visualization for all the polls being tracked along with the aggregate polling data.

All tabs have a clear button which allows you to clear any information which has been entered.
Exit the program by closing the graphical interface window.
